            Minuteman is a tool for transcribing and summarizing Jitsi meetings. It is designed to be used
            as a helping hand in making meeting notes in a group setting; the tool provides a live transcript and
            a summarization model that periodically summarizes the last X words. It is helpful for making
            a papertrail out of an exhausting meeting and keeping everyone on the same page.

        <div class="new-session-section">
            <form action="{{ url_for('new_minuting') }}" method="post">
                <label for="debug_mode_toggle">Use debug mode</label>
                <input type="checkbox" id="debug_mode_toggle" name="debug_mode_toggle">
                <input type="submit" value="Give me a new session!" class="create-session-button">

        <h2>User guide</h2>
        <p>
        When you click the link above, you will be taken to a new page with a control
        bar and two editors. The control bar will prompt you to enter a Jitsi room name.
        When you enter a room name and hit connect, a new meeting member will pop up in the meeting.
        It will record all the audio from the meeting participants and transcribe it in real time.
        the resulting transcript will appear live in the left editor.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you wish to have a little more insight into what parts of the transcript are summarized into what,
        you can turn on debug mode in the session creation form. The transcript utterances will then have visible sequence 
        numbers prepended and each summary line will have a prefix describing the ID and the starting and ending
        utterances of the summarized segment.
        </p>
        <p>
        The tool is best used in a group. Feel free to share the link to the session with other participants.
        They will then be able to see the transcript and the summary and to edit it.
        </p>
        <p>
        Once enough transcript data has been accumulated, summary bullet points will start appearing
        in the right editor. These bullet points are generated by a summarization model. If you want
        to summarize a particular part of the meeting, you can highlight it in the transcript editor
        and press Ctrl + Alt + S. This will send the highlighted text to the summarization model and
        create a bullet point in the summary editor.
        </p>
        <p>
        As the transcription mechanism is not perfect, you may want to edit the transcript. You can do
        that freely. The summary bullet points that correspond to the edited text will be updated
        accordingly. If you want to edit the summary bullet points, you can do that too. Once you
        edit a bullet point, it will be frozen and will not be updated again even if the corresponding
        part of the transcript has been edited.
        </p>
        <p>
        When you are done with the meeting, you can press the disconnect button in the control bar.
        </p>
