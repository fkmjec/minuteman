<h2>User guide</h2>
<p>
When you click the link above, you will be taken to a new page with a control
bar and two editors. The control bar will prompt you to enter a Jitsi room name.
When you enter a room name and hit connect, a new meeting member will pop up in the meeting.
It will record all the audio from the meeting participants and transcribe it in real time.
the resulting transcript will appear live in the left editor.
</p>
<p>
Once enough transcript data has been accumulated, summary bullet points will start appearing
in the right editor. These bullet points are generated by a summarization model. If you want
to summarize a particular part of the meeting, you can highlight it in the transcript editor
and press Ctrl + Alt + S. This will send the highlighted text to the summarization model and
create a bullet point in the summary editor.
</p>
<p>
As the transcription mechanism is not perfect, you may want to edit the transcript. You can do
that freely. The summary bullet points that correspond to the edited text will be updated
accordingly. If you want to edit the summary bullet points, you can do that too. Once you
edit a bullet point, it will be frozen and will not be updated again even if the corresponding
part of the transcript has been edited.
</p>
<p>
When you are done with the meeting, you can press the disconnect button in the control bar.
